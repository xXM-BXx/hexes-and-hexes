# Quick Start

This is a simple quick start guide how to clone my project and get it running.

1. You will need to be on Windows, since i am using SoLoud as an Audio Manager.

2. You can clone the code with this command:

```bash
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/GE/Teaching/gl3/projects/2024/18-gl3-burckhard.git
```

3. Once cloned, you can open the root folder in CLion. And load the `CMAKEList.txt` file

4. In CLion go to Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Toolchanins add the Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler (2019 or 2022) and hit Apply

5. You should now have a running configuration -> compile the code and have fun!
