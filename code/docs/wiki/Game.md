# How to play my game

A short description of the game can also be found when starting the game and clicking the "Tutorial" button.

Hexes & Hexes is a turn based High Score game, so the basic goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible and survive. 

### Player
The player character has a diverse actions to accomplish that goal. 
Those actions can be selected on the left side of the screen. 
The list of actions has several pages, and there are arrow buttons that can be clicked to go through those pages.
When the buttons are grayed out, you reached one end of the list.
The Action List Buttons themselves feature a relatively descriptive name, a cooldown timer, and a description that is shown, when hovered.
The description contains damage numbers and the cooldown of actions.
The cooldown timer will show the maximum cooldown when it is not currently on cooldown. 
After selecting an action a blue marker will follow the mouse, displaying the affected tiles.
When clicking the action is then executed. 
The player can execute to actions per turn.
### Enemies
There are three types of enemies. The first is just red, and runs towards the player and then explodes, when next to the player.
The second type has a silver ring on his hat. He can attack the player from range and will try to move so he has line of sight to the player.
The third and strongest enemy has gold markings on his hat and robe, and he deals more damage, can hit around some corners, and can execute two actions per turn.
Enemies will spawn in higher and higher quantities and strength, until it plateaus in activation 90. 
### Other
#### Activations
Cooldowns are not measured in turns, but in activations. Each activation is the actions of one character.
This means you may be able to use strong attack on each of your turns, when enough enemies were activated in between.
#### Cover
Most attacks require line of sight to the target tile. Line of sight is not interrupted by other characters, only by the crystals your actions can spawn.
You will notice missing line of sight by the blue marked tiles disappearing. Area of Effect attacks do only require line of sight to their center,
which allows attacking around corners.
