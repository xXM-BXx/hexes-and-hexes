# Hexes and Hexes
A game and engine built in C++ with OpenGL.

## Usage

You can do whatever you want with the game or the engine. Feel free to credit me/link back to this page though. 
If you create something cool with it you can also let me know, then i will link to it here.
Also feel free to fork the game for Linux or Mac. The source code should not contain any dependencies, but I didn't test or compile for other systems.

For more detailed usage information see the [wiki](https://github.com/xXM-BXx/hexes-and-hexes/wiki)

If you just want to play it: download a release, unzip it, and run the executable.
